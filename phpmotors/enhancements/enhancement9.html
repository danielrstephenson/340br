      <h1>Enhancement 9</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>In this enhancement you are asked to implement enhanced functionality for the site based on image uploads. This enhancement will consist of three general tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Run the current vehicle images through the new image upload tool, which will move them to a new location, and add their file path to the database.</li>
        <li>Revise some of the work that was done last week in order to get the vehicle details from the inventory table, but the path for the large, primary image from the images table.</li>
        <li>Add new functionality so that we can add vehicle thumbnails to the vehicle detail page and style everything to look professional.</li>
      </ol>


      <h2>Video Overview</h2>
      <p>This short video demonstrates what the finished enhancement will look like and the functionality it should possess.</p>

      <h2>Tasks</h2>
      <h3>Add Vehicle Images</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Change the target of image uploads in the uploads controller to the "<b>vehicles</b>" folder within the phpmotors "<b>images</b>" folder from the current "uploads > images" folder.</li>
        <li>Delete all records from the images table so that it is empty.</li>
        <li>Make a duplicate of the <b>vehicles</b> folder to your desktop. Once done, delete all of the images inside the <b>images/vehicles</b> folder in the PHP Motors site.</li>
        <li>Upload all existing vehicle images using the upload process so that the images will be sized correctly and stored into the "<b>images</b>" table of the phpmotors database and to the "images > vehicles" folder. <mark>Each of these uploads should be designated as "Primary" images.</mark></li>
        <li>Add the DMC DeLorean to the inventory table.</li>
        <li>Upload the DeLorean image and associate it with the car, making it the primary image.</li>
        <li>Associate the "no-image" picture to the "Dog Car" in the inventory table. Make it the primary image for that vehicle.</li>
        <li>Add at least one additional image to <b>three</b> vehicles. These images will NOT be primary images, rather they will be additional images for the vehicle.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Revisions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Alter the code for the home view so that the large, primary DeLorean image is now displayed in the home view from its location in the "phpmotors/images/vehicles" folder. </li>
        <li>When done uploading the images you will need to alter the functionality for displaying vehicles by classification. All images should now be obtained from the images table and not the inventory table. In the model it will require the use of a "<a
             href="//www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_inner.asp" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">JOIN</a>" and a
          "<a href="//www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">LIKE</a>" in the in the query, as well as limiting images to primary, thumbnail images. When done, click each classification item in the navigation bar and make sure the primary thumbnail image of each vehicle appears in the classification view and is from the images table.</li>
        <li>Revise the function for obtaining an individual vehicle's details to display in the detail view so that the vehicle details is still obtained from the inventory table, but the primary, large image comes from the images table. <mark>This function should only obtain the large, primary image from the images table, and the non-image details from the inventory table</mark>.</li>
        <li>Do NOT alter the function that obtains vehicle information that is used in the vehicle editing process.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>New Functionality</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>When the "vehicle detail" view is loaded the large, primary image should display (again, from the images table). But what if additional images have been uploaded for that vehicle? It would be beneficial if "thumbnails" of all images pertaining to that item were displayed. Therefore:
          <ol>
            <li>In the uploads model, <mark>build a new function that will obtain thumbnail image information from the "<b>images</b>" table that are based on the vehicleId.</mark> You will need to use the <a href="//www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">LIKE</a> operator in your SQL query to find "-tn" in the file name.</li>
            <li>In the <b>vehicles</b> controller, call the function when the vehicle detail page is requested. <b>The uploads model will have to be brought into the controller's scope.</b></li>
            <li>The returned list of thumbnail images should be fed into a custom function that will wrap them in HTML so they are ready to be viewed. No additional information about the image needs to be included, just the thumbnail image itself with an "alt" value added to the image.</li>
            <li>The HTML containing the images should be included into the "vehicle detail" view by the "vehicle" controller when the view is delivered and styled to be professional in appearance. The thumbnails must appear on the left of the vehicle detail information on large screens, and below the information on mobile screens. On mobile screens a heading should appear above the thumbnail images.</li>
            <li>Add CSS that will cause a thumbnail to enlarge in size when hovered over. When the mouse leaves the thumbnail image, it should return to normal size. This should occur only on large screens, not mobile devices.</li>
            <li>Add at least one additional non-primary image (it doesn't matter if they actually match the vehicle) to at least three inventory vehicles.</li>
            <li>To test, access the "vehicle detail" view via the car classification view. Make sure the additional thumbnail images appear and are professional in their appearance. The view should continue to be valid HTML5 and valid CSS3 when done.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
