      <h1>Enhancement 1</h1>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This enhancement is a review of the concepts, skills and techniques that should have been learned in WDD 230 - Web Frontend Development. It requires you to build a template and home page from that template for a fictitious web site - PHP Motors.
      </p>

      <h2>When done, you will have created:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Two php web pages: a template and a home page</li>
        <li>The pages will meet the standards shown in the <a href="https://ammonshepherd.github.io/340br/phpmotors/views/dev-checklist.html">Frontend Checklist</a>.</li>
        <li>The pages will use PHP modularization for the header, navigation and footer</li>
        <li>The home page will include the content shown in the sample images</li>
        <li>Both pages will look similar to the images provided</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notice!</h2>
      <p>All HTML and CSS should be of your own creation. You will learn more if no outside templates or frameworks are used. The real world revolves around CSS frameworks, though, so you may use one if you prefer. Be aware that the professor or TAs for the course may not be able to help you trouble shoot or fix errors if using a CSS framework.</p>

      <h3>Video Overview</h3>
      <p>This video provides a brief demonstration of what your finished enhancement should look like and how it should
        behave once done.</p>
      <p>The video says to go to <a href="http://localhost/phpmotors/">http://localhost/phpmotors/</a> in the browser. You can also use <a href="http://lvh.me/phpmotors">http://lvh.me/phpmotors/.</a></p>

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_XI8z-yhrk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <h2>Assumptions</h2>
      <p>This enhancement assumes that you can code semantic and valid HTML5, CSS3 (including the use of media queries and
        responsive layouts) and implement the basic design principles of Proximity, Alignment, Repetition and Contrast. In
        addition,
        basic usability concepts can be implemented readily. The review materials listed in the overview page are meant to
        help brush up with these skills as needed.</p>

      <h2>Download</h2>
      <p>A zip file containing a base folder along with subfolders of <a href="/340br/phpmotors/downloads/starter-assets.zip" title="Download the zip file to get started">starter assets should be downloaded</a>, unzipped and placed in your <code>cse340/www/phpmotors/</code> folder (or <code>htdocs/phpmotors/</code> folder if using XAMPP). After you unzip the file, move the <code>css</code> and <code>images</code> folders from the zip file to the <code>cse340/www/phpmotors/</code> folder (or <code>htdocs/phpmotors/</code> folder if using XAMPP). All subsequent work with the PHP Motors web site will be performed here.</p>

      <h2>Tasks</h2>
      <h3>Build a Template</h3>
      <p>You are to build a generic template for the PHP Motors web site (a template is a page that contains no content, it is a resource from which actual content pages, known as views, can be built). You will create a copy of this <code>template.php</code> file when you create other files in this course. </p>

      <p>You can view the <code>template.php</code> page at <a href="http://lvh.me/phpmotors/template.php">http://lvh.me/phpmotors/template.php</a> or <a href="http://localhost/phpmotors/template.php">http://localhost/phpmotors/template.php</a>. Remember to include the file name in the URL in order to view the file. Otherwise you will get an error saying the website is forbidden.</p>

      <p>See the illustration below:<br>
        <img src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/template.png" alt="An image of the PHP Motors template">
      </p>

      <p>The template must:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>use the .php file extension,</li>
        <li>use HTML5 semantic structures (header, nav, main and footer) for page sectioning,</li>
        <li>include the viewport meta element,</li>
        <li>include the <b>media="screen"</b> attribute for the css link element,</li>
        <li>use the color scheme shown:<br>
          <img src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/motors-colors.png" alt="PHP Motors color swatches">
        </li>
        <li>use fonts of your choice, but they should fit the automotive look and feel,</li>
        <li>be fully responsive to a variety of devices so that the content loads without horizontal scrolling or zooming
          (see the video illustration below),</li>
        <li>use usability concepts, the minimum expectations are:
          <ul>
            <li>links contain title attributes</li>
            <li>images contain alt attributes</li>
            <li>fonts are easily read and contain clear contrast between background and foreground colors</li>
            <li>headings form a meaningful document outline with no levels being missed</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>use external CSS for all styling. The CSS must:
          <ul>
            <li>be stored in the provided css folder,</li>
            <li>start with a mobile first approach (this means that CSS for mobile devices is outside of media queries,),</li>
            <li>be responsive to varying screen sizes of a variety of devices,</li>
            <li>use media queries for responsive layout only for larger screen sizes (don't go overboard here, limit the number of media queries to one or two - but remember that CSS inside media queries adjusts styles for larger devices),</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>use modularization for common content (e.g. page header, navigation and footer) by:
          <ul>
            <li>Creating a folder in which to store the common code snippets.</li>
            <li>Create a separate code snippet for the PHP Motors header, navigation and footer and store each into the folder.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions in the "<b><a href="https://ammonshepherd.github.io/340br/phpmotors/views/modularization.html">Modularizing Common Content</a></b>" activity to implement the snippets into the template. (See the link in the Week 02 Overview page, in the Activities section.) </li>
            <li>Be sure to thoroughly test that the code from the code snippets get delivered to the template file, and later to the actual web pages (views) that you build using the template.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>weigh less than 500Kb total weight, and</li>
        <li>be valid HTML5 and CSS3 code.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Build the PHP Motors Home View</h3>
      <p>Having built the template, you will now use it to build the PHP Motors home view. Make a copy of the <code>template.php</code> file and name it <code>home.php</code>.</p>

      <p>You can view the <code>home.php</code> page at <a href="http://lvh.me/phpmotors/home.php">http://lvh.me/phpmotors/home.php</a> or <a href="http://localhost/phpmotors/home.php">http://localhost/phpmotors/home.php</a>. Remember to include the file name in the URL in order to view the file. Otherwise you will get an error saying the website is forbidden.</p>

      <p>The view must:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>be named "home.php" and be stored at the root of the <b>phpmotors</b> folder,</li>
        <li>contain the content as shown in the images below and images are found in the images folder,
          <figure><img src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/home_page.png" alt="Picture of the PHP Motors home page for large screen"
                 style="border: 1px solid #000; width: 75%;">
            <figcaption><i>PHP Motors home - Large Screen</i></figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure><img style="max-width: 320px;" src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/home_page_small.png"
                 alt="Picture of the PHP Motors home page for mobile screen" style="border: 1px solid #000;">
            <figcaption><i>PHP Motors home - Mobile Screen</i></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>Write your CSS to position the page content to match as closely as possible the provided images of the home.php view in both large screen and mobile screen layouts. You may need to adjust some colors to pass the WAVE accessibility test.</li>
      </ol>
