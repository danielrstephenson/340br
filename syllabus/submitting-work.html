      <h1>Submitting Work</h1>
      <dl style="line-height: 1.5">
        <dt><b>Q: How will I submit my work?</b></dt>
        <dd><b>A:</b> All work for this class is done and submitted to the designated weekly assignment's code submission page as a zip file of the folder containing the work. In addition, you will create a screencast of the finished work and push the code to a personal private GitHub repository. You will then paste the URLs for the video and GitHub repo in the comment field of the assignment code submission page.</dd>

        <dt><b>Q: Why do I include a video URL when I submit my work?</b></dt>
        <dd><b>A:</b> It serves as an additional validation that your work is operating. The video <b>MUST</b> be narrated by you as you perform the tasks. In cannot be silent or be only music. The videos demonstrate completion of each point in the Grading Matrix which is used by the teacher to grade the assignment. Making such a video helps you complete the assignment successfully. </dd>

        <dt><b>Q: How will the professor or teaching assistant find my work to assess it?</b></dt>

        <dd><b>A:&nbsp;</b>Each assignment has an Enhancement Code Submission page. You submit a zip file of the project directory, a link to the video, and a link to the GitHub repo for each enhancement on the appropriate page. </dd>

        <dt><b>Q: How will the grader see my database?</b></dt>

        <dd><b>A:</b> In most cases, the professor or teaching assistant will not need to see the database. But, when necessary you will asked to show it in your assessment video. The final project will require you to submit a SQL file of the entire database. By including a zip of the entire project directory and through the use of Docker, the professor or assistant can replicate your development environment exactly.</dd>

        <dt><b>Q: In the grade book, I see the name of assessments listed more than once. Each one has a different number accompanying it. Why the duplicates?</b></dt>

        <dd><b>A:</b> Each number refers to a course objective. This class is graded based on demonstrated mastery of course objectives. In order for the I-Learn grade book to accept a score for each objective that a particular assessment may include, it requires a separate grade book entry.</dd>

        <dt><b>Q: What if I have questions about completing or submitting an assessment?</b></dt>

        <dd><b>A:</b> Use the Discussion Boards (early) to ask your question because chances are that if you have a question, others will also have that same question. Then, when someone finds the answer and posts it, everybody now the answer. The professor will monitor the Discussion Board for each week, and if another student doesn&rsquo;t answer your question, the professor will, or you can always ask the professor or teaching assistant directly.</dd>

        <dt><b>Q: Why am I required to work with others on my assessments?</b></dt>

        <dd><b>A:</b> The number one skill we hear from employers that hire our students is that they want people who can work with others. You are still expected to do your own work, but you have to be able to collaborate and communicate. By requiring you to work together to solve the problems and build the necessary tools to complete the task, you learn how to successfully cooperate and communicate with other people.</dd>
