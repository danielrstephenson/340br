                <h1>Tutoring Center Tutors</h1>
                <p>The campus Tutoring Center offers online tutoring for courses. To sign up for a tutor do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <a href="//iplan.byui.edu/" title="Open the link in a new tab" target="_blank">iplan.byui.edu</a>. If you are not already logged into your BYU-Idaho account, you will be prompted to enter your BYU-Idaho username and password.</li>
                    <li>Select “Tutoring” at the top of the screen.</li>
                    <li>On the home screen, you will see “Quizzes,” “Get a Tutor,” and “Videos.” Select “Get a Tutor” to make an appointment with a tutor. (Note that many classes have online quizzes and videos available for student use.)</li>
                    <li>Select the course for which you want a tutor.</li>
                    <li>Select “Online Tutoring Center.” A pop-up will come up requiring you to agree to the terms and conditions of the tutoring center. (Please note that the Tutoring Center does not currently charge international online students for missed appointments.)</li>
                    <li>Once you agree to terms and conditions, you will see availability for your subject. Select a time which will work for you to meet with a tutor.</li>
                    <li>A pop-up will show you who the tutor is for that time slot and provide the tutor’s contact information. The location will always say “2nd floor of Library, East Wing, Tutoring Center,” but online students will always be tutored online. The pop-up has a comment box which allows you leave a comment for the tutor so the tutor knows what to prepare for the appointment (please provide this information).</li>
                    <li>Select “Save Availability.” You will receive an email confirming your appointment and the tutor will receive an email with the appointment information.</li>
                    <li>Before your appointment, email or text the tutor to let them know you are an online student. Check your email for information from the tutor about how to log on to the online appointment. Don’t hesitate to contact your tutor before the appointment to confirm.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This is a great service and is an additional means of getting help for our course.</p>
