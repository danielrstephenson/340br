        <h1>CSE 340 Syllabus</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This course prepares students to plan, develop and construct dynamic web sites using HTML5, CSS, PHP, SQL
          and MySQL databases.
          <b>This is a programming course, previous programming experience will be helpful.</b>
        </p>

        <h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
        <p>For success you will need the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A strong work ethic and the ability to solve problems and meet deadlines.</li>
          <li>The ability to work well with others - supporting, communicating, teaching and learning from them.</li>
          <li>A laptop computer with 8Gb or more of RAM (recommended), 64-bit fully threaded operating system and
            wireless capability.</li>
          <li>A SitePoint Premium account. Purchase an
            <a href="https://www.byuistore.com/p-28053-sitepoint-premium-access-code.aspx" title="Open link in a new tab"
              target="_blank">account voucher from the BYU-Idaho Bookstore</a>. Then use the provided link that
            accompanies the voucher to create your account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="objectives">Course Objectives</h2>
        <p>You will demonstrate both the knowledge and skills to create dynamic web sites using:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>principles introduced in Web Frontend Development I - WDD 230;</li>
          <li>PHP â€” variables, arrays, functions and control structures;</li>
          <li>the Model-View-Control (MVC) design pattern to develop site applications;</li>
          <li>MySQL database(s) for storing data and SQL queries to carry out data interactions;</li>
          <li>data validation (client-side and server-side) appropriate to the task;</li>
          <li>effective team operations by teaching and learning collaboratively, communicating clearly, fulfilling
            assignments and meeting deadlines.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>This course is another step to become a web developer - which requires you to both know and do. In order to
          know something
          you must study, reflect and practice. To do requires effort and application to implement your knowledge. This
          class requires both knowing and doing.</p>

        <p>Contrary to many classrooms where you work alone, this class
          <strong>requires</strong> you to work with others. You will form learning teams and these teams will be a
          primary source to turn to for help and feedback. However, ultimately <strong>YOU</strong> are responsible for
          your learning and for the results of your efforts.</p>

        <h2 id="summative">Assessments</h2>
        <p>Each listed assessment relates directly to one or more course objectives, indicated in brackets. Specific
          due dates are listed in the assessment document. All assessments will be posted to your own web site; once
          posted, an assessment
          should remain unchanged until the grade appears in the grade book. The professor, teaching assistant (TA) or
          peer(s) will grade each assessment, using a provided grading matrix.</p>

        <p>It is
          <strong>YOUR</strong> responsibility to thoroughly read and understand the specification for each assessment
          and <b>test</b> your own work prior to your work being graded. Self and peer reviews using the grading matrix
          prior to due
          dates is encouraged.</p>

        <h3>Teaching Presentation [Objective 6]</h3>
        <p>Select a topic from the Teaching Presentation List and develop a 7-minute (maximum) teaching presentation
          where you will teach others about the topic. Read the specific requirements for the teaching presentation and
          view the grading
          matrix for the teaching presentation in the Teaching Presentation module.</p>

        <h3>Enhancements [various]</h3>
        <p>Each enhancement requires you to solve problems and demonstrate application of a variety of PHP, database,
          SQL or related concepts. Each enhancement will require you to submit your solution code to the appropriate
          assignment dropbox and post a video of the working application online and share the link to the video when
          submitting the code. Enhancements are found in the weekly modules.</p>

        <h3>Weekly Reports</h3>
        <p>Each week you will submit a report that accounts for your completion of content requirements, interaction
          with your learning team, efforts in making yourself and others successful through collaborative teaching and
          learning, and assessment completion. Each report is in the format of a quiz that will be taken at the
          conclusion of the week.</p>

        <h3>Final Project [All Objectives]</h3>
        <p>You will build a final project web application to specifications provided to you in week 12. The project
          will allow you flexibility and creativity while demonstrating your ability to implement the concepts and
          skills of this course.
          The finished project is due the last week of the semester as specified in the class schedule. This is a major
          element of the course. Read the project description in the Final Project module.</p>

        <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
        <p>Grading in this course is competency based. This means that your grade is based on your <b>demonstrated
            competency of each course objective</b>. Each assessment is tied and scored directly to one or more course
          objectives.</p>

        <p>Your grade in the course is based on the number of course objectives of which you have demonstrated mastery.
          <b>Passing course objectives, not the gross percentage of the class, determines the final course grade.</b>
          Each objective
          is graded Pass / Fail. To pass an objective you must earn at least 80% of the points allocated to it. It is
          critical that you are always doing your best work, on time and error free &mdash; <b>Do not submit junk!</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Course Grade Scale</h2>
        <table id='gradetable'>
          <tr>
            <th>Objectives Passed</th>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Grade Earned</th>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>B</td>
            <td>C+</td>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>C-</td>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>D-</td>
          </tr>

        <h2>Warning</h2>
        <p>
          <b>You must be self-motivation to succeed in this course.</b> There are expectations of constant learning and
          application &mdash; be anxiously engaged! Previous students have commented that you can do well in this
          course only if you stay caught up and work to grasp the concepts and apply them. Take their advice! <strong>It
            is expected that you will dedicate a minimum of 9 hours per week on this class. Do not plan less.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2 id="help">Getting Help</h2>
        <p>Students frequently find that they need help and there are a number of ways of getting help: 1) your
          learning team, 2) the teaching assistant, 3) the open web lab, 4) tutors and 5) the professor. It is not a
          matter of if, rather when, you will need help. Act quickly when you need help. Do NOT put it off!</p>
