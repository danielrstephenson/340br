    <h1>Learning Teams</h1>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Objective #6 for this course states that you will build dynamic web sites by, "effective team operations by teaching and learning collaboratively, communicating clearly, fulfilling assignments and meeting deadlines."</p>
    <p>In addition, in the professor's philosophy statement as found in the syllabus, it reads, "Contrary to many classrooms where you work alone, this class requires you to work with others. You will form learning teams during week 2 and interact with these teams weekly as a primary source of help and feedback. However, ultimately YOU are responsible for your learning and for the results of your efforts."</p>

    <h2>When?</h2>
    <p>During the first week of the semester you will create an introduction video for yourself and post it to your YouTube or Vimeo channel. You will then post the URL to your video to the "Getting Acquainted " discussion board. It is everyone's responsibility to watch one another's videos and begin to make judgements about who they would like to work with.</p>
    <p>After watching the video's you should reach out to two or three others with an invitation to join together in a learning team or group. <b>It is strongly recommended that you be in similar time zones if in an online environment</b>.</p>
    <p>During week 02, you will report who the member's of your team are in the discussion board and in the Week 02 report.</p>

    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>Campus learning teams will sit and collaborate together during our scheduled class times. They may meet outside of class if needed. Each member of the team is expected to be present and participating with her or his team during class.</p>
    <p>Online learning teams <b>MUST</b> meet using a means and at a time that all team members agree upon. This requirement is for each week of the semester. You will be held accountable to report your meetings each week. Teams can alter their meeting times as needed due to individual circumstances.</p>

    <h2>Results?</h2>
    <p>Since requiring this weekly meeting and the forming of learning teams to work together and help one another, the professor has witnessed a significant increase in student learning and successful completion rate in the class (e.g. prior to implementation the pass rate was ~77%, after implementation the pass rate is ~90%). Of those completing the class, over 80% are with a grade of "A".</p>

    <h2>Industry Standard</h2>
    <p>After graduation, the vast majority of our web development students find themselves in working teams in their new jobs. These teams require constant communiction and the ability to integrate your skills and code into that of the team. There is no place nor tolerance for the "I work alone" mentality. Start your transition into this mindset now.</p>
